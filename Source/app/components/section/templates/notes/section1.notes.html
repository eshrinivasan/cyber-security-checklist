Where is personally identifiable information (PII) or firm sensitive information located on your systems or other electronic storage (include your branch offices and unregistered locations)?
<ul><li>PII or firm sensitive information – PII can include name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or financial records including customer accounts and holding information. Firm sensitive information can include data such as contact address information, email addresses, marketing plans, employee information, financial records, and tax filings, etc. Firms can list data at a group 
level such as Customer Account Information, or at the granular level such as social security number, customer name, date of birth etc. 
</li><li>Location – Location means where the electronic digital information is stored, such as on a network drive, system folder, laptop or email.  If the same data is stored in more than one location, complete a separate entry for each location. 
</li><li>Risk severity level – Assign a risk severity classification to the data (e.g., low, medium or high). There is no one-size-fits-all way to assign risk severity, but a firm may consider the severity of the impact to customers and the firm if the PII or firm sensitive data were compromised.</li>

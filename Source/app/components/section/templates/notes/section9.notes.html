You should consider having an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which detects when there is an attempt to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of your systems. Intrusion detection products are tools that can assist in protecting a company from intrusion by expanding the options available to manage the risk from threats and vulnerabilities. Intrusion detection capabilities can help a company secure its information. The tool could be used to detect an intruder, identify and stop the intruder, support investigations to find out how the intruder got in, and stop exploitation by future intruders. If the answer is No, you should conduct a risk assessment on whether to invest in an IDS, and whether the IDS should have intrusion protection system capabilities. For some background on IDS refer to https://www.sans.org/security-resources/idfaq/what_is_id.php. A very simple but effective method for the firm to detect vulnerabilities is to inform staff to contact someone when they think they see a threat (e.g., a phishing email).  This could be in the form of a hotline or email to the person who manages the firmâ€™s technology assets.

Consider conducting a <b>third party penetration</b> of your infrastructure or using existing staff to conduct a penetration test. Determine the scope of the systems you want tested taking into account risk and your resources. For example, will penetration testing be limited to identifying vulnerabilities or will the penetration attempt to obtain sensitive information from the firm? Will the test include outside threats, mainly the internet or will it also include internal (employee/vendor) tests? Should the test be done as a surprise without letting employees or users of your system know, or should you inform them? After conducting the test, firms should identify vulnerabilities and conduct a risk assessment of whether to remediate.

Prepare incident responses to which you are most likely to be subject. The response should include a communication plan to notify your senior executives who need to know about the incident. Firm senior executives should decide how to contain and mitigate the breach. You should run through different types of incidents they may suffer and plan how they would respond. Types of responses to consider include: full or partial shutdown of systems, disconnect system from the network, delete and reinstall malware, or disabling a user from system access. You can add to or delete from the list as appropriate to their business. Firms should also refer to the FINRA Firm <a href="http://www.finra.org/industry/firm-checklist-compromised-accounts">Checklist</a> for Compromised Accounts.
